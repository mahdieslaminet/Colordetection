# Color Detection Project

This project is designed to detect and recognize colors within images using Python and OpenCV.

## Overview

Color detection is achieved by analyzing the pixels of an image and identifying predominant colors. This process involves:

- **Loading an Image**: The script loads an image file from the specified path.
- **Analyzing Colors**: It analyzes the colors in the image and identifies the dominant colors present.
- **Displaying Results**: It displays the detected colors along with their corresponding RGB values.

## Setup

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/color-detection.git
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Usage

1. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```
    cd color-detection
    ```

2. Run the script:

    ```
    python color_detection.py --image <image_path>
    ```

Replace `<image_path>` with the path to the image file you want to analyze.

## Example

To detect colors in an image named "example.jpg", run the following command:

```
python color_detection.py --image example.jpg
```

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
